Smartcalcu Privacy Policy

Last updated: [Date]

This application, Smartcalcu, is designed to function primarily on your device.

Data Collection:
We do not collect any personal data. All calculation and conversion history is stored locally on your device using your browser's localStorage and is not transmitted to any server.

Currency Conversion:
For the currency conversion feature, the app makes a request to the public API at exchangerate.host. This request does not include any personal information. It only sends the base currency you have selected to fetch the latest exchange rates.

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at support@goworkstudy.com.
